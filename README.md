## 3. How the System Works

### Career Counselor Flow

```
User Input (Profile, Career, Budget, Time)
         │
         v
┌────────┴────────┐
│  Profile       │ (1) Analyzes education, skills, experience
│  Analyzer      │
│  Agent         │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         v
┌────────┴────────┐
│  Skill Gap     │ (2) Identifies missing skills for target career
│  Analyzer      │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         v
┌────────┴────────┐
│  Course         │ (3) Recommends courses based on budget

```

### Resume Reviewer Flow

```
User Input (Resume, Job Role, Action)
         │
         v
    ┌────┴────┐
    │ Resume  │──► Analyze → Structure, content, ATS score
    │ Analyzer│──► Suggest Improvements → Specific fixes
    │ Agent   │──► ATS Score → 0-100 scoring
    │         │──► Rewrite Summary → Better version
    └─────────┘
         │
         v
      Output
```

## 4. Architecture

The system follows a multi-layered architecture with agent orchestration and tool execution, as shown below:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           UI Layer (Gradio)            │
│   Career Counselor | Resume Reviewer   │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                  │
┌─────────────────┴───────────────────────┐
│         Agent Orchestration Layer       │
│   (Profile Analyzer, Skill Gap, etc.)   │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                  │
┌─────────────────┴───────────────────────┐
│         Tool Execution Layer            │
│    (analyze, score, suggest, rewrite)   │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                  │
┌─────────────────┴───────────────────────┐
│           Memory Layer (JSON)           │
│      Context-Aware Conversation        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 5. Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Anaconda (recommended)

### Step-by-Step

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd CareerSuite-AI

# Create and activate environment
conda create -n career_ai python=3.10
conda activate career_ai

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 6. API Setup

### Option A: Use Mock Mode (For Demo)
The app works out-of-the-box with **mock outputs** - no API key needed. This is perfect for:
- Demo videos
- Portfolio projects
- Assignment submissions

### Option B: Use Real API (Optional)
For live AI responses, you can add an OpenAI API key:

1. Get an API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root (a sample `.env.example` file is provided):
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
   ```
3. The system will use real AI when API key is available

**Note:** The current version uses mock outputs for demonstration reliability.

## 11. Advanced Features

### Context-Aware Memory
The system saves conversation history to JSON files:
- `memory.json` for Career Counselor
- `resume_memory.json` for Resume Reviewer

This enables:
- Follow-up queries within session
- Context preservation across interactions
- Demonstration of memory patterns

### Agent Collaboration Indicators
The UI shows:
- "Agents are Collaborating..."
- Pipeline flow: Agent 1 > Agent 2 > Agent 3 > Agent 4

This demonstrates the multi-agent collaboration concept clearly.

## 13. Notes & Limitations

### Current Status
- **Mock outputs** are used for demonstration reliability
- Works without any API key for immediate testing
- Ideal for portfolio demonstration, academic evaluation, and interview discussions

### For Real Usage
- Add OpenAI API key for live AI responses
- Replace mock data in functions with actual API calls
- Consider rate limits and billing when using real APIs

### Assignment Context
This project was built for an IIT Jammu internship assignment demonstrating:
- Multi-agent AI systems (CrewAI pattern)
- Tool-augmented agents (OpenAI SDK pattern)
- Professional UI with Gradio
- Clean code organization
